Download the zip file and extract the "rotodyne" folder into the "$FG_ROOT/AI/Aircraft" folder.

To use you will need to create a traffic file, see the wiki for instructions.

There is a simple AI Traffic Creator here:

At the moment this model is probably best used in a scenario rather than as normal AI traffic.
